How to cite OSeMOSYS-PuLP:



Dear Sir or Madam,

OSeMOSYS-PuLP is a stochastic modeling framework for long-term energy systems modeling.
It embeds a new code implementation of the OSeMOSYS modeling framework. The OSeMOSYS modeling 
framework has been collaboratively developed and supported by many individuals and organizations.
In addition to the main reference, we also would like to ask you to cite the two additional 
references A1 and A2 that both are key contributions to the development of the OSeMOSYS modeling framework. 

Thank you!
