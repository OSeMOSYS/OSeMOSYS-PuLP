OSeMOSYS-PuLP: A Stochastic Modeling Framework for Long-Term Energy Systems Modeling

# Description
OSeMOSYS-PuLP is a methodological framework for an empirical deterministic–stochastic modeling approach to utilize real-world datasets in long-term energy systems modeling. An application example is provided (UTOPIA BASE dataset), in which the initial application example of OSeMOSYS is used and modified to include real-world operation data from a public bus transport system. This version of OSeMOSYS is a futher developement of the high performance version with additional performance improvements and post processing. This version also includes changes to certain parameters to allow for addtional indexing. In this code, it is possibel to have timespecific variable costs. Changes to other parameters will be made available thrpough different branches.
