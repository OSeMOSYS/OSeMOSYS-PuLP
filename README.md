OSeMOSYS-PuLP: A Stochastic Modeling Framework for Long-Term Energy Systems Modeling

# Description
OSeMOSYS-PuLP is a methodological framework for an empirical deterministicâ€“stochastic modeling approach to utilize real-world datasets in long-term energy systems modeling. An application example is provided (UTOPIA BASE dataset), in which the initial application example of OSeMOSYS is used and modified to include real-world operation data from a public bus transport system. More information are provided in the scientific article in section **Citation**.

# OSeMOSYS-PuLP
This is the **educational version** of OSeMOSYS-PuLP

# OSeMOSYS-PuLP-HP
This is the **high performance (HP) version** of OSeMOSYS-PuLP.
Additional performance improvements will be developed for this code over time.
